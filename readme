there are 2 identical escape rooms (code here becomes critical section)
and it takes random time for the instructors to give clues(which are similar for both rooms)
multiple times during the escape room game.

The clues the instructors provides are sequential and if the one room gets the clues earlier the game is spoiled(race condition).
The groups can check if the instructors is available book him for instruction (lock the instructor).

Flow

chairs(thread) enters and enqueues
When chairs size >= 2
    then instructors welcomes two groups to their respective escape room, inEscapeRoom=true and 2x leave_chair and assigns a team odd and team even
    else sleep

While instructors gives clues (changes global variable)
    if teamOdd reads and even or teamEven reads and odd, then the teams lost (Each team is not supposed to read the same clues!)
    else they won

After 3 successful rounds of clues the teams escape the rooms!
